# What is system design?
- process of defining a software system's architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow to meet specific requirements
- creating a detailed blueprint for developers to build a robust, scalable, and efficient solution, considering performance, reliability, and user needs. 
- It bridges high-level concepts with concrete implementation, focusing on how different components (like databases, APIs, load balancers) work together.


# Why is system design important?
- it provides architectural blueprint for software that transforms complex requirements into a functional solution
- ensures scalable, reliable, performant, maintainable, efficient, and robust solution that meets user needs and business goals while managing costs and complexity
- ultimately guiding development and preventing costly failures
- It's the foundation that makes large-scale systems work by defining how components interact, handle traffic, and evolve over time.
